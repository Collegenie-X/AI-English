| 1 | Good morning, everyone. Let's start the meeting. | Good morning. |
| 2 | First, let's check last week's progress. John, how's the project? | The project is going well. We finished the design. |
| 3 | Good. Any problems? | Yes, we have a small issue with the budget. |
| 4 | What's the problem? | We need more money for materials. |
| 5 | How much more? | About $5,000. |
| 6 | I see. Let's discuss this later. Sarah, your update? | The marketing plan is ready. |
| 7 | Great. When can we launch? | Next week, if the budget is approved. |
| 8 | OK. Any other issues? | No, we're fine. |
| 9 | Good. John will fix the budget issue. Sarah will prepare the launch. | Understood. |
| 10 | Thank you, everyone. See you next week. | Thank you. Have a good day. |

| 1 | Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining. Let's get started with today's agenda. | Good morning. Thanks for having us. |
| 2 | Let's begin with project updates. John, would you mind giving us a status update? | Of course. I'm happy to report that we've completed the design phase ahead of schedule. |
| 3 | That's excellent news. Were there any challenges along the way? | Yes, we encountered some budget constraints that we need to address. |
| 4 | Could you elaborate on the budget situation? | We're looking at approximately $5,000 additional for materials to maintain quality. |
| 5 | I understand. Let's flag this for follow-up. Sarah, what's the status on marketing? | The marketing plan is finalized and ready for execution. I'd like to walk you through the key points. |
| 6 | Please do. What are the main highlights? | We're focusing on digital channels with a phased rollout starting next week. |
| 7 | That sounds solid. Are there any dependencies we should be aware of? | The launch timeline depends on the budget approval for John's project. |
| 8 | Noted. I'll expedite the budget review. Any other items to discuss? | I'd like to suggest we increase our check-in frequency during the launch period. |
| 9 | Good suggestion. Let's have daily stand-ups next week. John, please prepare a revised budget. | Will do. I'll have it ready by Wednesday. |
| 10 | Perfect. Thank you all for your contributions. Let's reconvene next Monday. | Thank you. Looking forward to it. |

| 1 | Good morning, everyone. I appreciate you carving out time for this. Let's dive into today's agenda and make this as efficient as possible. | Good morning. Glad to be here. |
| 2 | I'd like to kick things off with project updates. John, would you mind walking us through where we stand? | Absolutely. I'm pleased to share that we've not only completed the design phase but managed to do so three days ahead of schedule. |
| 3 | That's exceptional work. I imagine it wasn't without its challenges. What hurdles did you face? | The primary challenge has been resource allocation. We've identified a gap in our materials budget that warrants discussion. |
| 4 | I'd like to understand the scope of this. What are we looking at in terms of numbers? | We're looking at roughly $5,000 to maintain our quality standards. I've prepared a detailed breakdown if you'd like to review it. |
| 5 | That would be helpful. Let's circle back on this after Sarah's update. Sarah, where do we stand on the go-to-market strategy? | The strategy is fully baked and ready for execution. I've stress-tested it against various scenarios and I'm confident in our approach. |
| 6 | That's reassuring. What's your recommended timeline, and what are the critical success factors? | We're targeting a soft launch next Wednesday, with a full rollout the following Monday. The key dependency is resolving John's budget situation. |
| 7 | Understood. I'm committed to fast-tracking the budget approval. What's our contingency if there are delays? | I've built in a one-week buffer. We can pivot to a limited launch if necessary, though I'd prefer to avoid that. |
| 8 | Good foresight. Is there anything else that's keeping anyone up at night? | I'd recommend we increase our touchpoints during the launch window. Perhaps daily syncs to address issues in real-time. |
| 9 | I couldn't agree more. Let's implement daily stand-ups starting Monday. John, I'll need that revised budget by COB Wednesday. | Absolutely. I'll also include a risk mitigation plan alongside the budget revision. |
| 10 | Outstanding. This has been a productive session. Let's maintain this momentum. Same time next week, unless anything urgent comes up. | Thank you. I'm feeling optimistic about where we're headed. |

| 턴 | 발표자 | 청중 반응 |
|:---:|--------|----------|
| 1 | Good morning. Thank you for coming. Today I will talk about our Q3 results. | (주목) |
| 2 | First, I will show you the sales numbers. Then, I will explain our challenges. | (고개 끄덕임) |
| 3 | Here is our sales chart. As you can see, sales went up 15% this quarter. | (관심) |
| 4 | This is good news. Our new product did very well in the market. | (메모) |
| 5 | But we also had some problems. Our costs went up by 10%. | (우려 표현) |
| 6 | The main reason is higher material prices. We need to find cheaper suppliers. | Question: What about labor costs? |
| 7 | Good question. Labor costs stayed the same. Only material costs went up. | (이해) |
| 8 | For next quarter, we plan to cut costs by 5%. | Question: How will you do that? |
| 9 | We will find new suppliers and improve our processes. | (고개 끄덕임) |
| 10 | That's all. Thank you for listening. Any more questions? | Thank you. Very informative. |

| 1 | Good morning, everyone. I appreciate you taking the time to join this presentation. Today, I'll be sharing our Q3 performance analysis. | (주목) |
| 2 | My presentation is divided into three parts: first, our revenue highlights; second, cost analysis; and finally, our strategic outlook. | (메모) |
| 3 | Let me start with the good news. As this chart indicates, we achieved a 15% increase in sales, exceeding our target by 3 percentage points. | Impressive results. |
| 4 | This growth was primarily driven by our new product line, which captured 20% of the market within its first quarter. | (관심) |
| 5 | However, I'd like to draw your attention to some challenges. Our operational costs increased by 10%, putting pressure on margins. | Question: What's driving the cost increase? |
| 6 | Excellent question. The primary driver is a 15% surge in raw material prices, particularly steel and aluminum. | (우려 표현) |
| 7 | We've already initiated discussions with alternative suppliers to mitigate this impact going forward. | Question: What's the timeline for cost reduction? |
| 8 | We're targeting a 5% reduction by Q4, with full implementation by early next year. Let me share our action plan. | (메모) |
| 9 | In summary, strong revenue growth offset by cost pressures. Our focus for Q4 is operational efficiency without compromising quality. | (고개 끄덕임) |
| 10 | That concludes my presentation. I'd be happy to take any questions or discuss specific areas in more detail. | Thank you. Very comprehensive analysis. |

#### 🌳 고급 버전

| 턴 | 발표자 | 청중 반응 |
|:---:|--------|----------|
| 1 | Good morning. Before I begin, I want to acknowledge the exceptional effort our teams have put in this quarter. The results I'm about to share are a testament to that dedication. | (주목) |
| 2 | Over the next 20 minutes, I'll take you through a comprehensive view of our Q3 performance – not just the numbers, but the story behind them and what they mean for our strategic direction. | (관심) |
| 3 | Let's start with what I consider a remarkable achievement. We didn't just meet our revenue targets – we exceeded them by 15%, representing the strongest quarter in our company's five-year history. | That's outstanding. |
| 4 | But beyond the headline numbers, what excites me most is the composition of this growth. Our new product line, launched just 90 days ago, already commands a 20% market share. | Question: What drove such rapid adoption? |
| 5 | Great observation. The answer lies in our customer-centric approach. We spent 18 months listening to customer pain points before designing this product. That investment is paying dividends. | (메모) |
| 6 | Now, let me be transparent about the challenges. Our success came with cost pressures – a 10% increase in operational expenses that we need to address proactively. | What's your mitigation strategy? |
| 7 | I appreciate you asking that directly. We're implementing a three-pronged approach: supplier diversification, process optimization, and strategic automation. I have full confidence this will yield a 5% reduction by Q4. | (이해) |
| 8 | What keeps me optimistic is not just our plan, but our track record. Three years ago, we faced similar pressures and emerged stronger. History suggests we'll do the same here. | (고개 끄덕임) |
| 9 | To conclude, Q3 validated our strategy. The road ahead requires discipline on costs without sacrificing the innovation that got us here. I'm bullish on our trajectory. | (호응) |
| 10 | Thank you for your attention and engagement. I welcome any questions, challenges, or alternative perspectives. This is a dialogue, not a monologue. | Excellent presentation. Very insightful. |

| 1 | Thank you for meeting with us. We want to talk about the contract. | Thank you for coming. We're happy to discuss. |
| 2 | We like your product. But the price is too high. | What price were you thinking? |
| 3 | We want a 20% discount. | That's difficult. We can offer 10%. |
| 4 | 10% is not enough. We're buying a lot. | How much are you planning to order? |
| 5 | 1,000 units per month for one year. | That's a big order. We can do 15%. |
| 6 | Can you include free shipping? | We can do free shipping if you pay upfront. |
| 7 | We prefer to pay in 30 days. | OK, 30 days is fine, but shipping will cost extra. |
| 8 | How much for shipping? | $500 per month. |
| 9 | That works. Can we sign today? | Yes, I'll prepare the contract. |
| 10 | Great. Thank you for the deal. | Thank you. Looking forward to working with you. |

| 1 | Thank you for taking the time to meet. We're excited about the potential partnership. | The pleasure is ours. We've heard great things about your company. |
| 2 | We've reviewed your proposal and we're impressed with the quality. However, we need to discuss pricing. | We're certainly open to discussion. What did you have in mind? |
| 3 | Given our projected volume, we believe a 20% discount would be fair for both parties. | I understand your position. While 20% is challenging, we might have some flexibility. Can you share more about your volume commitments? |
| 4 | We're looking at 1,000 units monthly with a 12-month commitment. That's significant volume. | That's definitely substantial. Based on those numbers, I can offer 15% with potential for more as volume increases. |
| 5 | That's a good start. What additional terms would get us closer to our target? | If you could commit to a two-year agreement, I could bump that to 18%. |
| 6 | We'd need some flexibility on payment terms to consider a longer commitment. | What terms are you looking for? |
| 7 | Net 45 would help with our cash flow management. | Net 30 is our standard, but I could approve Net 45 for orders over 500 units. |
| 8 | That works. One more thing – what about shipping costs? | For this volume, I can offer discounted shipping at $300 monthly. |
| 9 | If you can include shipping at no cost, we have a deal. | Tell you what – free shipping for the first year, then we revisit. |
| 10 | That's fair. I believe we have the foundation for a strong partnership. | Agreed. I'll have our legal team draft the agreement by end of week. |

| 1 | I appreciate you making time for this discussion. Before we dive into specifics, I'd like to understand your company's priorities for partnerships like ours. | Thank you for that approach. We value partners who think long-term. Our priority is building relationships, not just transactions. |
| 2 | That resonates with us. We've been impressed with your product quality, which is why we're here. That said, the current pricing presents challenges for our business case. | I understand. We've invested significantly in quality, which is reflected in our pricing. But we're always open to creative structuring. What challenges are you facing? |
| 3 | Our board has approved a budget that requires approximately 20% cost reduction to make the numbers work. I want to be transparent about our constraints. | I appreciate the candor. While 20% is beyond our standard flexibility, let's explore how we might bridge that gap through value creation rather than pure price reduction. |
| 4 | I'm listening. What did you have in mind? | If you could commit to 1,000 units monthly over 24 months, we could structure this with volume tiers that progressively approach your target. Year one at 15%, escalating to 20% in year two based on performance. |
| 5 | That's creative thinking. However, a 24-month commitment introduces risk for us. How can we mitigate that? | Fair point. We could include a performance clause – if we miss quality benchmarks or delivery commitments, you get an early exit option at month 18. |
| 6 | That addresses one concern. We'd also need favorable payment terms to justify the longer commitment. | What structure would work for your cash flow needs? |
| 7 | Net 60 would provide the flexibility we need. I realize that's aggressive, but we're offering significant volume commitment in return. | Net 60 stretches our standard terms, but I can make it work if you agree to automatic ACH payments and provide a corporate guarantee. |
| 8 | We can work with that. The final piece is logistics. Shipping costs on this volume could materially impact our savings. | Here's my proposal: complimentary shipping for the duration of the agreement, provided monthly orders meet the 1,000 unit threshold. |
| 9 | I think we're aligned on all major points. Before I commit, I need to confirm with my CFO, but I'm optimistic this will close by end of week. | I understand the need for internal alignment. I'll hold these terms until Friday. If there's anything that helps move the decision, I'm a phone call away. |
| 10 | Thank you for your flexibility and partnership approach. This sets the foundation for a relationship that will benefit both organizations. | The feeling is mutual. Regardless of outcome, I've enjoyed this negotiation. It's been refreshingly collaborative. |

| 1 | Thank you for meeting with us today, Ms. Johnson. How has your quarter been going? | It's been busy but productive. Thank you for asking. |
| 2 | I'm glad to hear that. I've been reviewing your account and wanted to discuss some opportunities I've identified. | I'd be interested to hear your thoughts. |
| 3 | Based on your growth trajectory, I believe our premium support package could add significant value to your operations. | We've considered premium support before. What makes this the right time? |
| 4 | Great question. Your transaction volume has increased 40% this year. Our data shows companies at your scale see 25% fewer issues with premium support. | Those numbers are compelling. What's the investment required? |
| 5 | The premium package is $2,000 monthly, which typically pays for itself within three months through reduced downtime. | That's higher than I expected. What flexibility do you have? |
| 6 | I understand budget considerations. If you commit annually, I can offer a 15% discount, bringing it to $1,700 monthly. | That's more workable. What exactly is included? |
| 7 | You'd get 24/7 dedicated support, a named account manager – that would be me – and priority response times of under 2 hours. | The dedicated support is appealing. Can we try it for a quarter before committing annually? |
| 8 | Absolutely. We offer a 90-day pilot at the monthly rate. If you convert to annual, we'll credit the difference. | That sounds reasonable. What's the process to get started? |
| 9 | I can have the agreement ready by tomorrow. Implementation takes about a week, and I'll personally oversee the transition. | Let's proceed with the pilot. I'll discuss the annual option with my team after we see results. |
| 10 | Perfect. I'll send over the paperwork today. Thank you for your trust in us. Is there anything else I can help with? | That covers it for today. Thank you for the proactive approach. |

| 2 | I appreciate that self-awareness. Let's start with the positives. Your project delivery has been exceptional. | Thank you. I worked hard on improving my project management skills. |
| 3 | It shows. The client feedback on the Anderson project was outstanding. They specifically mentioned your responsiveness. | That's great to hear. I made client communication a priority. |
| 4 | Now, let's discuss growth opportunities. I've noticed some challenges with cross-team collaboration. | I agree. I've been so focused on my deliverables that I haven't engaged enough with other teams. |
| 5 | I'm glad you recognize that. Collaboration will be crucial as you move toward more senior roles. | What would you suggest to improve in this area? |
| 6 | I'd recommend attending other teams' stand-ups and volunteering for cross-functional projects. | That makes sense. I'd like to join the Q1 product launch team if possible. |
| 7 | I'll make that happen. Now, let's talk about your goals for next quarter. What do you want to achieve? | I'd like to lead a project independently and improve my presentation skills. |
| 8 | Those are excellent goals. For the project lead opportunity, the Thompson account could be a good fit. | I'd appreciate that opportunity. What would success look like? |
| 9 | Delivering on time and budget, while maintaining client satisfaction scores above 90%. | I'm confident I can achieve that. I'll create a detailed plan. |
| 10 | Perfect. Let's schedule a check-in in 6 weeks to monitor progress. Thank you, Sarah. Keep up the great work. | Thank you for the feedback and opportunities. I'm excited about next quarter. |

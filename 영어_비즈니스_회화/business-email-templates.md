Subject: Apology: Miscommunication Regarding Project Scope

Dear [Name],

I want to apologize for the confusion caused by my earlier communication about the project scope.

**The Miscommunication:**
I incorrectly stated that the additional features were included in the original quote. After reviewing our agreement, I realize this was my error.

**Clarification:**
• Original scope: Features A, B, C (as quoted)
• Additional features: D, E (require separate quote)

**Our Offer:**
Given my miscommunication, I'd like to offer the additional features at a 25% discount as a gesture of goodwill.

I should have been more careful in my initial communication, and I take responsibility for this confusion. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

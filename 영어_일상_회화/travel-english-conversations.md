| 8 | Please. What's the best way to brew it at home? | For this particular bean, I'd recommend a 1:16 ratio with water just off the boil. Do you have a pour-over setup? |

| 1 | Good morning. I was hoping you could help me figure out the best way to experience this museum. We have about 3 hours. | Good morning! Three hours is perfect. I'd recommend starting with our highlights tour, then exploring at your own pace. |
| 2 | That sounds ideal. What sets this museum apart from others in the city? | We have the largest collection of Impressionist works outside of France, and our modern art wing just opened last year. |
| 3 | The Impressionist collection sounds fascinating. Is there a particular piece I shouldn't miss? | Monet's "Water Lilies" series is here, and we have an original Renoir that many people travel specifically to see. |
| 4 | I've always wanted to see those in person. Is there a less crowded time to view them? | If you head there right after the tour, around 11:30, it tends to be quieter. Most people are at lunch by then. |
| 5 | Excellent tip. I was also wondering if there's anywhere to get a nice coffee and collect my thoughts? | Our rooftop café has stunning views of the city skyline. The coffee is actually quite good too. |
| 6 | That sounds like the perfect way to end the visit. What about the gift shop - any unique finds? | Our shop carries exclusive prints that you won't find anywhere else, and all proceeds support the museum's conservation efforts. |
| 7 | I love that. One more question - I'm a bit of a photography enthusiast. Any restrictions I should know about? | Professional cameras are fine in permanent collections, but the special exhibitions have stricter rules. I can give you a guide. |
| 8 | That would be wonderful. I promise to be respectful with my camera. | I can tell you appreciate art. Here's a map with the best photo spots marked - it's something we give to photography enthusiasts. |

| 1 | Good afternoon. I've been feeling unwell and need some help. | Good afternoon. Can you describe your symptoms? |
| 2 | I have a bad stomachache and I've been feeling nauseous since yesterday. | I see. Have you had any vomiting or diarrhea? |
| 3 | Yes, both. I think it might be from something I ate. | That's very possible. What did you eat recently? |
| 4 | I had some seafood at a street market two nights ago. | That could definitely be the cause. Any fever? |
| 5 | I felt warm last night, but I didn't check my temperature. | Let me take your vitals. You do have a mild fever. |
| 6 | Is it food poisoning? Should I be worried? | It appears to be a mild case. Nothing too serious. |
| 7 | What do you recommend for treatment? | I'll prescribe some antibiotics and anti-nausea medication. |
| 8 | How should I take them? | The antibiotic twice daily with food, the other as needed. |
| 9 | Is there anything else I should do? | Stay hydrated, stick to bland foods, and rest as much as possible. |
| 10 | Thank you so much, doctor. I really appreciate it. | You're welcome. If symptoms persist beyond 3 days, please come back. |

| 1 | Good afternoon, doctor. I hate to bother you, but I've been experiencing some concerning symptoms since yesterday. | Good afternoon. Please, it's no bother at all. Tell me what's been going on. |
| 2 | I've had persistent stomach cramps and nausea. It started mildly but has gotten progressively worse over the past 24 hours. | I understand. Have you experienced any other symptoms - fever, vomiting, changes in appetite? |
| 3 | I've had both vomiting and diarrhea, I'm afraid. My appetite is completely gone, and I felt feverish last night. | I'm sorry you're going through this. Can you think of anything that might have triggered it? |
| 4 | I suspect it might be something I ate. I had oysters at a restaurant two nights ago, and I'm starting to regret that decision. | Raw or cooked? And were you the only one who ate them, or were you with others? |
| 5 | They were raw. My friend had them too, but she seems to be fine. Perhaps my system is just more sensitive. | That's certainly possible. Everyone's tolerance is different. Let me examine you. |
| 6 | (검사 후) What's your assessment, doctor? I'm supposed to fly home in two days and I'm getting a bit worried. | You have a moderate case of food poisoning. With proper treatment, you should be well enough to travel. |
| 7 | That's a relief to hear. What treatment would you recommend? | I'm prescribing a course of antibiotics and medication for the nausea. I'll also give you electrolyte packets. |
| 8 | Should I follow any particular diet while I'm recovering? | Absolutely. Stick to the BRAT diet - bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. Avoid dairy and anything greasy. |
| 9 | That's very helpful. Is there anything I should watch out for that would require me to come back? | If you develop a high fever, see blood in your stool, or if symptoms worsen significantly, please return immediately. |
| 10 | I truly appreciate your thorough care, doctor. You've put my mind at ease. | It's my pleasure. I hope you feel better soon and that the rest of your trip is more enjoyable. |

## 💡 학습 팁

### ✅ 효과적인 학습 방법

1. **패턴 먼저, 단어 나중** - 패턴을 익힌 후 단어만 바꿔서 연습
2. **소리내어 연습** - 혼자서도 대화 상대방 역할까지 연습
3. **상황 상상하기** - 실제 상황을 머릿속으로 그리며 연습
4. **녹음해서 듣기** - 자신의 발음을 객관적으로 확인
5. **매일 10분** - 짧더라도 매일 꾸준히 연습

### ❌ 피해야 할 것들

1. 문법에 너무 집착하지 말 것
2. 완벽한 발음을 기대하지 말 것
3. 틀리는 것을 두려워하지 말 것
4. 한국어로 먼저 생각하고 번역하지 말 것

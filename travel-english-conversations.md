## 💡 학습 팁

### ✅ 현대 표현 학습법

1. **넷플릭스/유튜브** - 미국 드라마, 브이로그에서 자연스러운 표현 습득
2. **줄임말 먼저** - gonna, wanna, gotta 는 꼭 익히기
3. **리액션 연습** - Sweet! Awesome! 같은 감탄사 연습
4. **상황 상상** - 실제 상황을 머릿속으로 시뮬레이션

### ❌ 주의할 점

1. **너무 격식체만 쓰지 말 것** - 오히려 어색할 수 있음
2. **상황에 맞게** - 입국심사는 좀 더 정중하게
3. **슬랭 남용 금지** - 기본 표현부터 확실히
